/// The local function, which is an approximation \f$\hat{u} \approx u\f$ of a function \f$u: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m}\f$
/**
Let \f$\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}\f$ be the domain. 

A local function is defined by a cloud of support points \f$\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\f$ (see clf::SupportPointCloud) such that each support point \f$i\f$ is associated with a local function \f$\ell_{x_i}: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m}\f$.

The approximation \f$\hat{u}:\Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m}\f$ is defined piece-wise by functions \f$\ell_{x_i}(x) = \Phi_{x_i}(x) p_i\f$ associated with support point \f$x_i\f$ (see clf::SupportPoint), where \f$p_i \in \mathbb{R}^{\bar{q}_i}\f$ is a vector of coefficients associated with support point \f$i\f$.

If \f$I(x)\f$ is the index of the nearest support point to a point \f$x \in \Omega\f$, then we evaluate the approximation as \f$\hat{u}(x) = \Phi_{x_{I(x)}}(x) p_{I(x)}\f$.
